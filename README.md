### WenSen Ma

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a master's degree at Wuhan University (WHU) under the supervision of Prof. Yuling Jiao, with research interests in learning theory and deep representation learning, especially self-supervised learning. I focus on establishing theoretical understandings and developing novel approaches related to this field. In addition, I am also interested in understanding Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, and more. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me at vincen.nwu@gmail.com.
