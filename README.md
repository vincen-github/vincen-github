### Wensen Ma

Hello!

I'm currently pursuing my PhD degree in the Department of Applied Mathematics at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of Prof. [Defeng Sun](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-sun-defeng/?sc_lang=en) and Prof. [Houduo Qi](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-qi-houduo/?sc_lang=en). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Northwest University and my Master's degree from Wuhan University. I am grateful for the guidance provided by my Master's supervisor, Prof. [Yuling Jiao](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/jiaoyuling/en/index.htm).

My current research interests lie in statistical learning and deep learning theory, particularly in deep representation learning, self-supervised learning, and the theoretical foundations for large language models (LLMs). I focus on establishing theoretical understandings and developing novel approaches in these areas.

If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me at [vincen.nwu@gmail.com](vincen.nwu@gmail.com).
